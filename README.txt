NAME
       mqtt‐sys − MQTT "$SYS/#"‐subscriber for collectd exec

SYNOPSYS
       mqtt‐sys  [‐h  host ] [‐p port ] [‐C CA‐cert ] [‐u username ] [‐P pass‐
       word ] [‐K psk‐key ] [‐I psk‐identity ] [‐s] [‐N nodename ] [‐f metrics
       ] [‐t topic...  ]


DESCRIPTION
       mqtt‐sys  is  an executable program which is used with collectd(1).  It
       subscribes to the MQTT $SYS/# topic and/or to any number of topics  you
       specify, and prints values to stdout for collectd to process in an exec
       plugin block.

   MQTT subscriptions
       By default, mqtt‐sys subscribes to the $SYS/# topic tree of the	speci‐
       fied  MQTT  broker, but any number of topic subscriptions can be set up
       using the ‐toption.  Whether or not the payload of a  received  message
       is  actually  passed to collectd is defined by a metrics map which maps
       an MQTT topic name to a metric name with  a  particular	type  and  its
       numeric	value.	 It  is therefore quite possible that mqtt‐sys is sub‐
       scribed to a topic but doesn’t pass that to collectd.  (This  is  known
       as a configuration error.)


   Metrics map
       The MQTT topic to collectd metrics mapping is configured through a met‐
       rics file you provide. Lines which start with #	and  empty  lines  are
       ignored.  All other lines must have three white‐space separated tokens.
       The metric name which is what is passed to collectd, the  type  of  the
       metric (from types.db), and the MQTT topic name.

   InfluxDB
       As  an example, we show how to configure InfluxDB to accept values from
       collectd via the latter’s network plugin.  Configure InfluxDB to launch
       the native collectd input:

       [input_plugins]

	 [input_plugins.collectd]
	 enabled = true
	 # address = "0.0.0.0" # defaults to bind‐address.
	 port = 25826
	 database = "collectd"
	 # https://github.com/collectd/collectd/blob/master/src/types.db
	 typesdb = "/usr/share/collectd/types.db"


   collectd
       Configure  collectd  to	send  its  metrics to InfluxDB via the network
       plugin which talks to InfluxDB.	(Compare the  port  numbers  here  and
       above in InfluxDB.)

       LoadPlugin network

       <Plugin "network">
	 # influxdb
	   Server "127.0.0.1" "25826"
       </Plugin>

       Configure  collectd to load our executable mqtt‐sys via its exec mecha‐
       nism. Specify mqtt‐sys options as  individual  strings  in  the	"Exec"
       invocation.

       LoadPlugin exec

       <Plugin exec>
	  Exec "mosquitto:mosquitto" "/usr/bin/mqtt‐sys" "‐u" "jjolie" "‐P" "secret" "‐f" "/etc/metrics"
       </Plugin>


   Testing
       Launch  mqtt‐sys  on the command line; you should see PUTVAL statements
       being printed. If that works configure collectd as described above.

       To see if whether your values are being passed to InfluxDB:

       select * from "hippo/mqtt‐sys/connections‐connections.1m"
       select * from "hippo/mqtt‐sys/counter‐msgs.received"


OPTIONS
       −C ca‐file
	      specifies the PEM‐encoded CA certificate file to use for TLS.


       −h host
	      is the hostname or address of the MQTT broker. Unless  overriden
	      by ‐N this also sets the collectd nodename.


       −p port
	      gives the TCP port number for the MQTT broker; defaults to 1883.


       −s     use insecure TLS.


       −f metrics
	      is the path to the metrics file which defaults  to  "./metrics".
	      If this file cannot be read, the program exits with a diagnostic
	      message.


       −I psk‐identity
	      sets the identity for PSK.


       −t topic
	      may be specified multiple times and causes mqtt‐sys to subscribe
	      to that topic. Defaults to "$SYS/#" if not specified.


       −u  username
	      for the MQTT connection.


       −P  password
	      for the MQTT connection.


       −K  psk‐key
	      for the MQTT connection.



       −N  nodename
	      Overrides  the  collectd	node  name, which without this option,
	      defaults to the short local hostname or  the  value  of  the  ‐h
	      option
