 * The table of metric names we want to process.
 * Each metric has three values:
 *
 * 1. METRIC name which is what collectd gets. NULL if you don't want this topic.
 * 2. TYPE from the collectd types.db (left column)
 * 3. TOPIC as read from your MQTT broker
 *
 * This must be valid C source code.
